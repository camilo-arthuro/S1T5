Leve 1:
Exercise 1:

To compile the file.java we need to use the command javac in the console,
if we have the file.java in a package we can use the command "javac -cp package package\*.java":

- javac compile the file.java
- with -cp we indicate the route that we want to use
- with package we indicate the name of the package we want to use
- with package\*.java we indicate the route and the file

To execute the file.class we can use the command "java package/file".
- java is to execute the file.class
- package/file is the route and the file.class
We use the "package/file" because the file.class is in a package

To enter the route of the directory we can use the relative route ./N1EX1/Directory
